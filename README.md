# M1-8 writer

## Target Device

This script can write to LED name badge which ...

* has 12x48 LED matrix display (untested on 11x44).
* shows "M1-8" at startup.
* can be written by "LED Display" and "Mini LED Display".

]
```

### Body

Bitmap data are splitted line by line from the top and each line is splitted every 8 pixels from the left. 8-pixel data is represented as 1-byte packet. The left pixel is the high-order bit.

```python
# a 32px (=8*4) wide bitmap
[
    0b10101010, packet_002, packet_003, packet_004,  # line 1
    packet_005, packet_006, packet_007, packet_008,  # line 2
    packet_009, packet_010, packet_011, packet_012,  # line 3
    #         ... line by line ...
    0b10001000, 0b11001100, 0b11110000, 0b10110111
]
```

The first packet of data `0b10101010` represents `* * * * ` in top left corner and the last packet of data `0b10110111` represents `* ** ***` in bottom right corner (`*` is lit pixel).

Each bitmap data is written in parallel line by line from the top.

`bitmap_03_line_02` represents the 2nd line data of the 3rd bitmap.

```python
# 4 bitmaps
[
    bitmap_01_line_01, bitmap_02_line_01, bitmap_03_line_01, bitmap_04_line_01,
    bitmap_01_line_02, bitmap_02_line_02, bitmap_03_line_02, bitmap_04_line_02,
    bitmap_01_line_03, bitmap_02_line_03, bitmap_03_line_03, bitmap_04_line_03,
    #                          ... line by line ...
    bitmap_01_line_nn, bitmap_02_line_nn, bitmap_03_line_nn, bitmap_04_line_nn,
]
```

**NOTE**: You need to insert 32 bytes of null after the 16 byte of body.

## Feature

* Brightness: 1, 2, 3, 4 (for all bitmap)
* Write up to 8 bitmaps
    * Motion: left, right, up, down, freeze, animation, snow, curtain, laser
    * Speed: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
    * Option: show border, blink

## Requirement

* [pyserial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/) 3.4
* [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) 7.0.0

## Usage

Write 1 bitmap to slot 1:

```
m18write image.png
```

... and show bitmap brightest:

```
m18write --brightness 4 image1.png
```

... and show bitmap in maximum speed:

```
m18write --speed1 8 image.png
```

... and move bitmap left to right:

```
m18write --motion1 right image.png
```

Write 4 bitmaps to slot 1, 2, 3 and 4:

```
m18write image1.png image2.png image3.png image4.png
```

Write 2 bitmaps to slot 1 and 2, blink bitmap 1 and show border bitmap 2:

```
m18write --blink1 --border2 image1.png image2.png
```

Show help:

```
m18write -h
```

## Install

```
pip install m1-8-writer
```
